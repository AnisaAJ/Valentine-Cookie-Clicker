        <h2> Welcome to the Valentine Town! </h2>

        <p class="part-1"> You have inhereited your parents' Valentine's cookie factory. It has seen better days. 
            It used to be a great lively place around town, where everyone of all ages hung around. 
            A perfect spot for newly couples to visit for all sorts of different things. 
            Such as personalized cookies, shooting hearts, roses, letters, even cupids! </p>

        <p class="part-2"> Unfortunately, ever since the disappearance of your parents, the Valentine's Cookie Factory
            has long since been a forgotten gem, shrouded in the shadows of its past glory. 
            The vibrant colors have faded, the sweet scents of fresh cookies no longer fill the air, 
            and the laughter and joy that once echoed through its halls have quieted. But now, as its new owner, 
            you have the chance to restore the factory to its former splendor and bring back the warmth and love that Valentine's Day stands for.</p>
                
        <p class="part-3"> It won't be easy. The machines are rusty, the recipes are lost, and the competition is fiercer than ever. 
            But with determination, a sprinkle of creativity, and a dash of love, you can rebuild the factory from the ground up. 
            You'll start small, with just a few basic cookies and decorations. But as you gather more hearts and spread more love, 
            you can expand your offerings, upgrade your equipment, and maybe even discover some of your parents' long-lost cookie recipes.</p>
                
        <p class="part-4"> So roll up your sleeves, preheat the oven, and get ready to sprinkle a little bit of love on everything you bake. 
            The journey to restore the Valentine's Cookie Factory starts now. Who knows? Along the way, you might not only revive a business but also rediscover 
            the true meaning of Valentine's Day ;))).</p>

        <p class="part-5"> So what is your name? </p>
